## Analysis of sales data set

We use Python tools for the analysis of sales data. This data set consists of three csv files with information of 45 stores located in different regions. We try a small analysis of seasonal sales, and the dates corresponding to the highest amount of them.

**Content:**

- Stores.csv: with type and size.

- Features.csv: with additional data information like date of the week, temperature, unemployement, etc.

- Sales.csv: including store, date, weekly sales.
